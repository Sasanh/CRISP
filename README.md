# CRISP
Cancer-specific RNA-editing Identification using Somatic variation Pipeline (CRISP)


### Aligining raw RNA-Seq samples

We use [HISAT2](https://ccb.jhu.edu/software/hisat2/index.shtml), a fast and sensitive splice-aware aligner, to align the solid tumor cancer samples to Human Genome 19 (hg19) reference genome. (Here we assume that the proper preprocess of the RNA-Seq samples are already preformed.) 

```
hisat2 --dta -x hg19_index -1 rep1.fastq -2 rep2.fastq -S output.sam
```
